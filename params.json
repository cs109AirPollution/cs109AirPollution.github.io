Data was downloaded for the 6 key pollutants for the year of 2010.</p>\r\n<p><b>Historical Weather Data:</b></p>\r\n<p>US weather data was also obtained from the EPA's <a href=\"http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html/\">AirData</a> repository. This includes information of daily temperature, wind speeds, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. A secondary source of weather data came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Using their <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/\">FTP site</a>, more detailed breakdown of weather data including wind speeds, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and daily precipitation could be obtained for various stations across the US. This helped fill in missing data and get a finer image of US weather. </p>\r\n<p><b>Demographic Data:</b></p>\r\n<p>Demographic information for the CBSA's included in this research came from the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/population/metro/data/pop_data.html/\">US Census Bureau</a>. These files contain information about the total population, the total land area, and the population density of CBSAs in the year 2010, .</p>\r\n<p><b>Transit Data:</b></p>\r\n<p>To assess the influence of commuting style on pollutant levels, data on mode of commuting were collected from the 2010 <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/\">US Census Bureau</a>. These data included breakdown of commuters' modes of transportation into 'Driving Alone,' 'Carpooling,' 'Public Transportation,' and 'Other (Walk/Bike/etc.).'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All raw data can be found at the following <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cd95rdgrbm9cpz7/AAAG9758zR1tUMvGsxKtIJzXa?dl=0\">link</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"analysis\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#exploratory-data-analysis\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Analysis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Pollutant Data:</b> The six main pollutants included in our analyis are distributed somewhat differently. The violin plots below show the distribution of each pollutant across the months of 2010. The white dot represents the mean of that month whereas the spread of the values is represented by the filled area. While most pollutants remain fairly stable throughout the year, ozone levels seem to increase during the summer months and decrease during the winter. This is because O<sub>3</sub> creation can be a product of reactions involving temperature and light. NO<sub>2</sub> does the opposite and is higher in the winter months and lower in the summer months. This makes sense given the source of NO<sub>2</sub> is fuel combustion which one would expect to increase in colder months. There is an interesting outlier in the SO<sub>2</sub> data in January -- one station observed a very high value. This is a station located in Hilo, HI which makese sense given that the greatest source of SO<sub>2</sub> are natural emissions from things like volcanoes which are quite prevalent in Hawaii.</p>\r\n  <img src=\"PollutantDist.png\" alt=\"PollutantDist\" style=\"width:2000px;height:600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><b>Transit Data:</b> The following plot shows the distribution of transportaion modes across different areas. The shading in the back represents the total number of people in the area. The pies have split the percentage of people who commute using each of the transportation styles listed. You can scroll over the individual pies to get the numbers, zoom in and out, or move around the area to better explore the data. In general, the most dominant form of transportation is driving alone.</p> \r\n<iframe src=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/publish/PublicTransit/Sheet1#!/publish-confirm\r\n?:embed=yes&:tabs=yes&:toolbar=yes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> \r\n\r\n<p><b>Relationships Between Pollutants and Other Factors:</b> Given differences in pollutants across these different CBSAs, we can look to see how </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"authors-and-contributors\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#authors-and-contributors\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/821\" class=\"user-mention\">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
